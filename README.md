## ROS package: my_topics
### This is a simple message publisher and generates a message that is inputed into the command for the launch of a package. This can be useful for timing and setting up communication between different packages. This is helpful when trying to communicate with other packages such as my_services because it broadcasts the information for the other package.

## ROS package: my_services
### This package creates a server that has defined functions that other packages can reference and activate so that the server is running the function for the clients. This can be very useful for short timed requests, and will act out the command quickly.
